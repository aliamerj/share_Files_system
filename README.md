# share_Files_system

It's a full-stack website for uploading and downloading files.

When you upload a file, you get a link to this file, and with this link you can download this file.

You can secure your file with a password , so if somebody wants to download this file,

He has to enter the correct password, or you can make your file public so anyone with your file link can download it.

## for secure file I used JWT token expiring for 30s 
When you enter the correct password , the server will generate a JWT and attach it with a new link and redirect you to this new link 
with that you can download the file.

# clean code and very secure download system and  proper errors handler
